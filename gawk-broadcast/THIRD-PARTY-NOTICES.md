# Third-party notices — `gawk-broadcast`

The native Linux broadcaster (`gawk-broadcast`, `gawk-broadcast-gui`,
`gawk-pw-helper`). GStreamer is deliberately absent from this list: the
broadcaster runs `gst-launch-1.0` as a separate process installed by the
user's distribution, so no GStreamer code is linked or redistributed
here. `gawk-pw-helper` does dynamically link `libpipewire-0.3` (MIT),
which the user likewise supplies.

This file is generated. Do not edit it by hand — run
`python3 tools/licenses/gen-notices.py` and commit the result. See that
script for what counts as a dependency here and why.

**Scope:** `go list -deps ./...` in `gawk-broadcast/`.
